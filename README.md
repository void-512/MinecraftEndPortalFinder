# Minecraft End Portal Finder

This program calculates the intersection point of two sight lines in a game world in order to estimate the position of an *End Portal*

The calculation is based on two positions to release the *eye of ender* and the direction that each *eye of ender* is flying to.

The intersection of these two lines represents the estimated target location.
